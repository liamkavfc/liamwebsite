        I am a full stack developer who primarily writes in PHP. Although most of my experience is in front end technologies, I have a real passion for all things back end
        and I am always looking at ways to improve in this area to further enhance my skills. I like to use my free time as well as volunteering for particular projects in my
        day job to work towards this. I prefer to learn by doing instead of having my head buried in books! I am a keen learner and am always trying to learn new things.
        Currently I am learning Vue.js (this website is written in Vue) and a little bit of mobile app development.
