          I done this as part of my visa obligation to gain an extra year extension to my visa. It was such a good experience! We worked primarily on a potato digger but
          we got the whole farm experience of driving tractors, looking after cattle and much more!

          Working in the front end team to ensure customers WiFi portals get deployed with a professional UX &amp; UI feel. We are a small team in a much larger development
          team who we also work closely with which means we have a wider exposure to other products and technologies.

          This was my first full time job doing an apprenticeship through South Devon College. I was part of a very small team...there was only 2 of us. One for back end and then me,
          for front end. I was responsible for building the front end on all our websites which were primarily for clients in the food &amp; drink industry.
